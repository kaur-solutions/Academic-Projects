#Project Title

Time Series Forecasting – Predicting Product Sales (15-Day Horizon)

##Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the number of products sold over a 15-day forecast horizon using time series forecasting techniques. By leveraging historical sales data and machine learning models, the project aims to provide accurate forecasts that can help businesses optimize inventory management, improve supply chain efficiency, and enhance overall sales planning.

## Key Features

###Time Series Data Analysis:

Forecasting the number of products sold using historical sales records.

Visualizing trends, seasonality, and sales patterns.

#### Machine Learning Implementation:

Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and forecasting configurations.

### Evaluation Metrics:

Assessing model performance using MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

Plotting actual vs. predicted values for visual analysis.

Future Forecast Horizon: Predicting sales for the next 15 days, enabling better business planning.

## Technology Used

Python – For Manual ML 

Azure Machine Learning (AutoML) – for automated model generation.

Azure Blob Storage – for cloud-based data management.

k-Fold Cross-Validation – to ensure generalization of the model
